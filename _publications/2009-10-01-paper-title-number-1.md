This paper presents a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based approach for cooperative path following problem for multiple UAVs along with collision avoidance. The goal of each vehicle, in a fleet, is to track a given desired trajectory and coordinate with other vehicles to be in a desired formation, while avoiding collision with each other. We model the cooperative path following problem as an infinite horizon LQR problem which is solved to obtain the velocity and steering control commands.
