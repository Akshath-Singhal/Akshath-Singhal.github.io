I am a graduate student under the guidance of Dr. Alireza Ramezani working towards my PhD in Computer Engineering at College of Engineering, Northeastern University. I believe robotics possess a huge potential in our lives which has been largely untapped and wish to make some contributions in the field of robotic control.
