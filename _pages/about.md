<div style="text-align: justify"><p>I am a graduate student under the guidance of Dr. Alireza Ramezani working towards my PhD in Computer Engineering at College of Engineering, Northeastern University. I believe robotics possess a huge potential in our lives which has been largely untapped and wish to make some contributions in the field of robotic control.</p>

<p>I am interested in developing Unmanned Vehicle Systems which can operate, navigate, communicate and collaborate in cluttered and dynamic frameworks, like urban environments. My research interests lie in conception and design of novel control and task allocations techniques for achieving collaborative behaviour amongst a swarm of heterogenous aerial and ground robots.</p>
<p>I did my Bachelors of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Delhi Technological University (formerly called Delhi College of Engineering). I was the student mentor of Unmanned Aerial Systems Lab, DTU where I worked with Prof. N S Raghava.</p> </div>
